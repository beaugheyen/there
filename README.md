# there

Welcome, everyone.

Beau here. Disruptive Mediator, Convener, Innovator, Motivator...
at least that's what I aim to be. Working on Partner, Friend, Son, Uncle, Neighbor, been a bit distracted.

Like you, this project has been everything to me. Sacrafice, failure, luck, hard work and passion have brought us here. Together, let's finish our work to get everyone there: livibg on a spaceship, under the ocean, bellow the Earth's surface or in the same town we grew up in. 

In service,
Beau G Heyen
